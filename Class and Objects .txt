Class

Class is a description of an object's property and behavior
Creating class is as good as creating data type
** Class is defining a category of data **

Object

Object is a real world entity.
Object is an instance of a class.
** Object consumes memory to hold property values **


** In Java object will create using new() keyword **

class Box{
    // these are the properties
    // instance variable member length, breadth, height
    private int length, breadth, height;

    // these are the methods
    // instance member functions
    public void setDimension(int l, int b, int h){
        length = l;
        breadth = b;
        height = h;
    }

    public void showDimension(){
        System.out.println("length: " + length+" breadth: " + breadth+" height: " + height);
    }


}

class Example{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Box smallBox = new Box();
        smallBox.setDimension(1,2,3);
        smallBox.showDimension();

        // above 33  and 34 line will gone to garbage collecotr becuase object is referring to another instance.

        // smallBox is aka refernceVariable

        smallBox = new Box();
        smallBox.setDimension(3,4,5);
        smallBox.showDimension();
    }
}
