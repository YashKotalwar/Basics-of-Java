Constructor is a member function of a class.

The name of constructor is the name of the class.

Constructor has no return type.

why do we need constructor?

A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called implictly, just after the memory is allocated for the object.

just aapn object create kela and kahi assign nahi kela values vagere tr default memory location madhe values zero assign hotil. pn object create kela nantr 1 step madhe constructor call hoto. he apyla manavr ahe ki constructor define karycha cha ka nahi.

It is not mandatory for the coder to write the constructor for class

When there is no constructor define in the class by programmer, compiler implictly provide a default constructor for the class.


default constructor

example

Class Box{
    public Box(){}
}
