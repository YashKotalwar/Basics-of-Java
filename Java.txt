- robust means fault tolerance which means it handles the any situation
- multi threading means two action can run simultaneously. eg in word we are writing and auto spelling check also happening
* features - simple, object oriented lang, robust, multi threading, portable, secure, garbage collector, interpreted

JVM - Java Virtual Machine
to run the Java code (or .class file (byte code)) we use JVM.
JVM is different for different OS.[ Platform Dependent ]
JVM is software

JIT - Just-in-time Compiler
compiler means it converts the code into other format which machine can understand and stored in somewhere so it can execute so many times as we want

[ summary - it creates the new file and stores the translated code ]

interpreter it read the code line by line and it translate the code and given to operating system and os will execute

[ summary - it doesnot store the code ]

How to compile
Hello.java -> Hello.class
source file to byte code

How to run
Hello.class -> JVM --(JIT Compiler) -> OS

JDK - Java Development Kit
we need jdk because we can develope the java code.
it responsible for converting the code into byte code.
In jdk we also have compiler (javac.exe), application launcher(java.exe)

** javac.exe used for creating .class file or byte code **
** java.exe used for start java program **


JRE - Java Runtime Enviornment
for running the java code
It contains the JVM and Java Package Classes(Java Library)


Access Specifers - 1. Public 2. Private 3. Protected ( extended from parent class and we can use in the child class)
4. Default

System.out.println()

System is the class. In system class we have out refernece variable which represent the object


run ->
1. javac ClassName.java [ convert to byte code ]
2. java ClassName [ run the byte code ]


What is Data Type?
A type identifies a set of values (and their representions in memory) and a set of operations that transforms these values into other values of that set.

** String is not primitive type **

primitive type - predefined type or in-built-in type
Primitive Type                  Size
boolean                         implementation Dependent
char                            16bits (Stores unicode)
byte                            8bits -128 to 127
short                           16bits -32768 to 32767
int                             32bits -2147483648
long                            64bits -9223372036854775808
float                           32bits
double                          64bits



Integer constant can be specified in the decimal, hexadecimal, octal or binary format

127 decimal
0x7f hexadecimal [7x base 16] ->  0x is prefix
0177 octal -> 0 is prefix
0b011101100 binary -> 0b is prefix


** byte range can be specified in the -128 to 127 **
** short range can be specified in the -32768 to 32767 **

Permitted Conversions Type

byte to short, int, long, float, double
short to int, long, float, double
char to int, long, float, double
int to long, float, double
long to float, double
float to double


Class

Class is a description of an object's property and behavior
Creating class is as good as creating data type
** Class is defining a category of data **
