Function Overloading or Method Overloading -

If two methods of a class have same name but signatures(paramerters) that are not same, then the method is said to be overloaded.

Method Overloading is a way to implement polymorphism.


Function Overriding or Method Overriding -

A method in subclass with the same signatire with specific implementation in respect to the subclass.

Why Overriding?
Hiding the parent class details.


when static keyword is not present in the method then we can do overrdding.
if it is present then its a function hiding.


If subclass has a method method m with same signature as of the method present in the superclass, then method m hides the method of superclass.
