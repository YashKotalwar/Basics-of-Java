Scanner Class

Scanner class is final class, that is can not extended. [ we can't create child class. ]

We can read java input from System.in using Scanner class

A scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern [ending point], which by default matches whitespace

The resulting tokens may then be converted into values of different types using the various next methods.


System.in takes input and put in buffer
Scanner takes input from buffer and convert it into data type.


Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = sc.nextInt();
